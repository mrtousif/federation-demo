# Federation demo with Apollo and Fastify

This repository is a demo of using GraphQL Gateway to build a single schema on top of multiple services. The microservices are located under the [`./services`](./services/) folder and the gateway that composes the overall schema is in the root. The repository contains the original Apollo Federation example and also a [mercurius](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius) example for comparison.

## What is this?

This demo showcases four partial schemas running as federated microservices. Each of these schemas can be accessed on their own and form a partial shape of an overall schema. The gateway fetches the service capabilities from the running services to create an overall composed schema which can be queried.

## Installation

To run this demo locally, pull down the repository then run `npm install` in the root and in the `apollo` and `fastify` folders.

This will install all of the dependencies for the gateway and each underlying service.

## Running the demo

### Apollo

For running the demo for Apollo, first go the `apollo` folder and run the following commands

```sh
npm run start-services
```

This command will run all of the microservices at once. They can be found at http://localhost:4001, http://localhost:4002, http://localhost:4003, and http://localhost:4004.

In another terminal window, run the gateway by running this command:

```sh
npm run start-gateway
```

This will start up the gateway and serve it at http://localhost:4000

### Fastify/Mercurius

For running the demo for Fastify/Mercurius, first go the `fastify` folder and run the following commands

```sh
npm run start-services
```

This command will run all of the microservices at once. They can be found at http://localhost:3001/graphiql, http://localhost:3002/graphiql, http://localhost:3003/graphiql, and http://localhost:3004/graphiql.

In another terminal window, run the gateway by running this command:

```sh
npm run start-gateway
```

This will start up the gateway and serve it at http://localhost:3000/graphiql

## Benchmark

For running the benchmark, first run both demo apps and then run the following command in the root:

```sh
node bench.js
```

It will run the benchmark for 5 seconds for each demo. It wil print the results to the console.
